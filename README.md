# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data
# Course Project

	You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Directions
	1. Download datasource (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) to folder on local drive. Extract data and move UCI HAR Dataset into working directory (optional.) 
	2. Move run_analysis.R into UCI Har Dataset (top folder.); set working directory to "UCI Har Dataset"
	3. Run run_analysis.R
